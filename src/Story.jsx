        <p className="font-monteserrat font-normal text-base  tracking-wider"> In ancient India, nestled among the Himalayan mountains, a group of individuals embarked on a quest for deeper meaning in life. They yearned for a connection with something greater, something that would infuse their existence with purpose and significance.<br/><br/>

         Their exploration led them to discover an ancient wisdom that had been passed down through the agesâ€”the wisdom of Yoga. With its roots dating back over 5,000 years, Yoga emerged as a transformative practice, encompassing physical, mental, and spiritual dimensions. It was the path to connect with the divine and tap into a universal consciousness that transcended the material world.
